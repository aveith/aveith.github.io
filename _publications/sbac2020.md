## Abstract
The Internet of Things has enabled many application scenarios where a large number of connected devices generate unbounded streams of data, often processed by data stream processing frameworks deployed in the cloud. Edge computing enables offloading processing from the cloud and
placing it close to where the data is generated, thereby reducing the time to process data events and deployment costs. However, edge resources are more computationally constrained than their cloud counterparts, raising two interrelated issues, namely deciding on the parallelism of processing tasks (a.k.a. operators) and their mapping onto available resources. In this work, we formulate the scenario of operator placement and parallelism as an optimal mixed-integer linear programming problem. The proposed model is termed as Cloud-Edge data Stream Placement (CESP). Experimental results using discrete-event simulation demonstrate that CESP can achieve an end-to-end latency at
least ' 80% and monetary costs at least ' 30% better than traditional cloud deployment.
